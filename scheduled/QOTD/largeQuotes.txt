Citizen G'Kar : If I take a lamp and shine it toward the wall, a bright spot
will appear on the wall. The lamp is our search for truth... for understanding.
Too often, we assume that the light on the wall is God, but the light is not
the goal of the search, it is the result of the search. The more intense the
search, the brighter the light on the wall. The brighter the light on the wall,
the greater the sense of revelation upon seeing it. Similarly, someone who does
not search - who does not bring a lantern - sees nothing. What we perceive as
God is the by-product of our search for God. It may simply be an appreciation
of the light... pure and unblemished... not understanding that it comes from
us. Sometimes we stand in front of the light and assume that we are the center
of the universe - God looks astonishingly like we do - or we turn to look at
our shadow and assume that all is darkness. If we allow ourselves to get in the
way, we defeat the purpose, which is to use the light of our search to
illuminate the wall in all its beauty and in all its flaws; and in so doing,
better understand the world around us.

born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most
special care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not
be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen
years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.

You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The
dangers were too great. But Muad'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers.
There was Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of
Gurney's songs as you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old
Mentat Master of Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah
Emperor. There were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington
Yueh, a name black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who
guided her son in the Bene Gesserit Way, and--of course--the Duke Leto, whose
qualities as a father have long been overlooked.
    from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
----
How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth
and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the
way to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he
held for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there--a
man snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory
of his son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?

With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing
implant-legends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition.
The wisdom of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the
protection of B.G. personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen
a condition-utextremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The
prophetic legends had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels
(including Reverend Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a
panoplia propheticus). And it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's
latent abilities were grossly underestimated.

Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of
Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the
others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was
in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could
learn. It's shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and
how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every
experience carries its lesson.
    from "The Humanity of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
----
What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you
carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: "Any road
followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just
a little to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you cannot
see the mountain."

It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he
walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had
lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its
intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son
might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily
hoodwinked.
    from "Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan
----
Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a
poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad'Dib was to repeat many
times. He say it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal
command post to participate in his father's first full staff conference. The
words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell
with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with
death. They said: "O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your
prayers."
    from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
----
On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his
family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy
and they ventured to shout: "Mahdi!" But their shout was more a question than a
statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan
al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on
the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious
to them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.

My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in
the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall
of Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong
resemblance between them--my father and this man in the portrait--both with
thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes.
"Princess-daughter," my father said, "I would that you'd been older when it
came time for this man to choose a woman." My father was 71 at the time and
looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember
deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his
son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.
    "In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan
----
Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in
part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences
greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is
projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is
what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that
permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional
greatness will destroy a man.

    from "Songs of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
----
When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto's death and the manner
of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my
mother and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He
blamed the Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not
excepting even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I
sought to comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of
self-preservation to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he
sneered at me and asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had
been aroused to this passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that
death implied for all royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have
been some prescience in my father, too, for it is certain that his line and
Muad'Dib's shared common ancestry.
    from "In My Father's House," by the Princess Irulan

Muad'Dib could indeed, see the Future, but you must understand the limits of
this power. Think of sight. You have eyes, yet cannot see without light. If you
are on the floor of a valley, you cannot see beyond your valley. Just so,
Muad'Dib could not always choose to look across the mysterious terrain. He
tells us that a single obscure decision of prophecy, perhaps the choice of one
word over another, could change the entire aspect of the future. He tells us
"The vision of time is broad, but when you pass through it, time becomes a
narrow door." And always, he fought the temptation to choose a clear, safe
course, warning "That path leads ever down into stagnation."

our edge.
    from "Muad'Dib: Conversations" by the Princess Irulan
----
Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but
I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real
friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of
the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little
man, brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by
my mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter
of self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the
Bene Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but
the intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became
adept, my mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It
may seem a dreadful thing to say, but I'm not at all sure my father was
innocent in all these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here
was a new slave-concubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and
graceful. She had a dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included
neuro-enticement. My father looked at her for a long time as she postured
unclothed before him. Finally he said: "She is too beautiful. We will save her
as a gift." You have no idea how much consternation this restraint created in
the Royal Creche. Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly
threats to us all.

This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize
as "The Pillars of the Universe," whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with
signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose
profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but
stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by "The
Old Man's Hymn"?
I drove my feet through a desert
Whose mirage fluttered like a host.
Voracious for glory, greedy for danger,
I roamed the horizons of al-Kulab,
Watching time level mountains
In its search and its hunger for me.
And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach,
Bolder than the onrushing wolf.
They spread in the tree of my youth.
I heard the flock in my branches.
And was caught on their beaks and claws!
    from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan

Prophecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the
unanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the "wave
form" (as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet
shaping the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the
act of prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of
weakness, a fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a
diamond-cutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?

My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he
encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He
seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg's
black helmet with the Imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an
open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though.
When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in
these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a
man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must
remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back
into the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most
terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors
where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History
already has answered.

When any government, or any church for that matter, undertakes to say to its
subjects, 'This you may not read, this you must not see, this you are forbidden
to know,' the end result is tyranny and oppression, no matter how holy the
motives. Mighty little force is needed to control a man whose mind has been
hoodwinked; contrariwise, no amount of force can control a free man, a man
whose mind is free. No, not the rack, not fission bombs, not anything'you can't
conquer a free man; the most you can do is kill him.

All writers are vain, selfish and lazy, and at the very bottom of their motives
lies a mystery. Writing a book is a long, exhausting struggle, like a long bout
of some painful illness. One would never undertake such a thing if one were not
driven by some demon whom one can neither resist nor understand.

As with the Christian religion, the worst advertisement for socialism is its

At 50, everyone has the face he deserves.

Autobiography is only to be trusted when it reveals something disgraceful. A
man who gives a good account of himself is probably lying, since any life when
viewed from the inside is simply a series of defeats.
    George Orwell

But the thing that I saw in your face no power can disinherit: No bomb that

Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind

Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted,

Good novels are not written by orthodoxy-sniffers, nor by people who are

    George Orwell
----
He is a man of thirty-five, but looks fifty. He is bald, has varicose veins and
wears spectacles, or would wear them if his only pair were not chronically
lost. If things are normal with him, he will be suffering from malnutrition,
but if he has recently had a lucky streak, he will be suffering from a
hangover. At present, it is half past eleven in the morning, and according to
his schedule he should have started work two hours ago; but even if he had made
any serious effort to start, he would have been frustrated by the almost
continuous ringing of the telephone bell, the yells of the baby, the rattle of
an electric drill out in the street, and the heavy boots of his creditors
clumping up the stairs. The most recent interruption was the arrival of the
second post, which brought him two circulars and an income tax demand printed
in red. Needless to say, this person is a writer.
    George Orwell
----
He is as antisocial as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a

He is fiddling while Rome is burning, and, unlike the enormous majority of

He left behind, as his essential contribution to literature, a large repertoire
of jokes which survive because of their sheer neatness, and because of a
certain intriguing uncertainty - which extends to Wilde himself - as to whether
they really mean anything.

He who controls the past commands the future. He who commands the future

Most people get a fair amount of fun out of their lives, but on balance life is

Most revolutionaries are potential Tories, because they imagine that everything

One can love a child, perhaps, more deeply than one can love another adult, but

One of the effects of a safe and civilized life is an immense oversensitiveness
which makes all the primary emotions somewhat disgusting. Generosity is as
painful as meanness, gratitude as hateful as ingratitude.

Part of the reason for the ugliness of adults, in a child's eyes, is that the
child is usually looking upwards, and few faces are at their best when seen

Political speech and writing are largely the defense of the indefensible.

Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in

Power-worship blurs political judgment because it leads, almost unavoidably, to

Probably the battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton, but the

Progress and reaction have both turned out to be swindles. Seemingly, there is

    George Orwell

Progress is not an illusion, it happens, but it is slow and invariably
disappointing.

Prolonged, indiscriminate reviewing of books is a quite exceptionally

Saints should always be judged guilty until they are proved innocent.

Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred,
jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in

So much of left-wing thought is a kind of playing with fire by people who don't

The Catholic and the Communist are alike in assuming that an opponent cannot be

The English are probably more capable than most peoples of making revolutionary

The atmosphere of orthodoxy is always damaging to prose, and above all it is

The atom bombs are piling up in the factories, the police are prowling through
the cities, the lies are streaming from the loudspeakers, but the earth is

    George Orwell

The books one reads in childhood, and perhaps most of all the bad and good bad
books, create in one's mind a sort of false map of the world, a series of
fabulous countries into which one can retreat at odd moments throughout the
rest of life, and which in some cases can survive a visit to the real countries
which they are supposed to represent.
    George Orwell
----
The child thinks of growing old as an almost obscene calamity, which for some
mysterious reason will never happen to itself. All who have passed the age of
thirty are joyless grotesques, endlessly fussing about things of no importance
and staying alive without, so far as the child can see, having anything to live
for. Only child life is real life.
    George Orwell
----
The essence of being human is that one does not seek perfection, that one is
sometimes willing to commit sins for the sake of loyalty, that one does not
push asceticism to the point where it makes friendly intercourse impossible,
and that one is prepared in the end to be defeated and broken up by life, which
is the inevitable price of fastening one's love upon other human individuals.
    George Orwell
----
The existence of good bad literature - the fact that one can be amused or
excited or even moved by a book that one's intellect simply refuses to take
seriously - is a reminder that art is not the same thing as cerebration.
    George Orwell
----
The great disadvantage, and advantage, of the small urban bourgeois is his
limited outlook. He sees the world as a middle-class world, and everything
outside these limits is either laughable or slightly wicked.
    George Orwell
----
The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between
one's real and one's declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long
words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish squirting out ink.
    George Orwell
----
The high sentiments always win in the end, the leaders who offer blood, toil,
tears and sweat always get more out of their followers than those who offer
safety and a good time. When it comes to the pinch, human beings are heroic.
    George Orwell
----
The intellectual is different from the ordinary man, but only in certain
sections of his personality, and even then not all the time.
    George Orwell

The main motive for "nonattachment" is a desire to escape from the pain of
living, and above all from love, which, sexual or non-sexual, is hard work.
    George Orwell
----
The moralist and the revolutionary are constantly undermining one another. Marx
exploded a hundred tons of dynamite beneath the moralist position, and we are
still living in the echo of that tremendous crash. But already, somewhere or
other, the sappers are at work and fresh dynamite is being tamped in place to
blow Marx at the moon. Then Marx, or somebody like him, will come back with yet
more dynamite, and so the process continues, to an end we cannot foresee.
    George Orwell
----
The "Communism" of the English intellectual is something explicable enough. It
is the patriotism of the deracinated.

There is hardly such a thing as a war in which it makes no difference who wins.
Nearly always one side stands more or less for progress, the other side more or
less for reaction.
    George Orwell
----
Throughout recorded time ... there have been three kinds of people in the
world, the High, the Middle, and the Low. They have been subdivided in many
ways, they have borne countless different names, and their relative numbers, as
well as their attitude towards one another, have varied from age to age: but
the essential structure of society has never altered. Even after enormous
upheavals and seemingly irrevocable changes, the same pattern has always
reasserted itself, just as a gyroscope will always return to equilibrium,
however far it is pushed one way or the other. The aims of these three groups
are entirely irreconcilable.
    George Orwell
----
To a surprising extent the war-lords in shining armour, the apostles of the
martial virtues, tend not to die fighting when the time comes. History is full
of ignominious getaways by the great and famous.

To accept civilization as it is practically means accepting decay.
    George Orwell
----
To an ordinary human being, love means nothing if it does not mean loving some
people more than others.
    George Orwell
----
To say "I accept" in an age like our own is to say that you accept
concentration-camps, rubber truncheons, Hitler, Stalin, bombs, aeroplanes,
tinned food, machine guns, putsches, purges, slogans, Bedaux belts, gas-masks,
submarines, spies, provocateurs, press-censorship, secret prisons, aspirins,
Hollywood films and political murder.

To survive it is often necessary to fight and to fight you have to dirty

To walk through the ruined cities of Germany is to feel an actual doubt about
the continuity of civilization.
    George Orwell

To write or even speak English is not a science but an art. There are no
reliable words. ... Whoever writes English is involved in a struggle that never
lets up even for a sentence. He is struggling against vagueness, against
obscurity, against the lure of the decorative adjective, against the
encroachment of Latin and Greek, and, above all, against the worn-out phrases
and dead metaphors with which the language is cluttered up.

We of the sinking middle class ... may sink without further struggles into the

Do not worry; eat three square meals a day; say your prayers; be courteous to

Few can be induced to labor exclusively for posterity; and none will do it

Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a

government of the people, by the people, and for the people, shall not perish

I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to
tremble for the safety of my country. Corporations have been enthroned, an era

people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is
destroyed.

If I care to listen to every criticism, let alone act on them, then this shop

If you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his

It is the eternal struggle between these two principles - right and wrong. They

Labor is prior to, and independent of, capital. Capital is only the fruit of

Prohibition goes beyond the bounds of reason in that it attempts to control a

    Abrahamham Lincoln
----
Prohibition will work great injury to the cause of temperance. It is a species
of intemperance within itself, for it goes beyond the bounds of reason in that
it attempts to control a man's appetite by legislation, and makes a crime out
of things that are not crimes. A Prohibition law strikes a blow at the very
principles upon which our government was founded.

Quarrel not at all. No man resolved to make the most of himself can spare time
for personal contention. Still less can he afford to take all the consequences,
including the vitiating of his temper and loss of self control. Yield larger
things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones,
though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him
in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.

Reject your sense of injury and the injury itself disappears.

Remember how often you have postponed minding your interest, and let slip those
opportunities the gods have given you. It is now high time to consider what
sort of world you are part of, and from what kind of governor of it you are
descended; that you have a set period assigned you to act in, and unless you
improve it to brighten and compose your thoughts, it will quickly run off with
you, and be lost beyond recovery.

The essence of the Liberal outlook lies not in what opinions are held, but in

Thinking you know when in fact you don't is a fatal mistake, to which we are

I had supposed until that time that it was quite common for parents to love
their children, but the war persuaded me that it is a rare exception. I had
supposed that most people liked money better than almost anything else, but I
discovered that they liked destruction even better. I had supposed that
intellectuals frequently loved truth, but I found here again that not ten percent
of them prefer truth to popularity.
    Bertrand Russell

Science can teach us, and I think our own hearts can teach us, no longer to

You must not kill your neighbor, whom perhaps you genuinely hate, but by a
little propaganda this hate can be transferred to some foreign nation, against
whom all your murderous impulses become patriotic heroism

Right discipline consists, not in external compulsion, but in the habits of
mind which lead spontaneously to desirable rather than undesirable activities.
    Bertrand Russell
----
It is illegal in England to state in print that a wife can and should derive
sexual pleasure from intercourse
    Bertrand Russell
----
What a man believes upon grossly insufficient evidence is an index into his
desires -- desires of which he himself is often unconscious. If a man is
offered a fact which goes against his instincts, he will scrutinize it closely,
and unless the evidence is overwhelming, he will refuse to believe it. If, on
the other hand, he is offered something which affords a reason for acting in
accordance to his instincts, he will accept it even on the slightest evidence.
The origin of myths is explained in this way.
    Bertrand Russell
----
Life is a brief, small, and transitory phenomenon in an obscure corner, not at

Every advance in civilization has been denounced as unnatural while it was

Democracy is the process by which people choose the man who'll get the blame.
    Bertrand Russell

To teach how to live without certainty, and yet without, being paralyzed by
hesitation, is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy in our age can do for
those who study it

All who are not lunatics are agreed about certain things : That it is better to
be alive than dead, better to be adequately fed than starved, better to be free
than a slave

Machines are worshipped because they are beautiful, and valued because they
confer power; they are hated because they are hideous, and loathed because they
impose slavery

By self-interest, Man has become gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to
a great extent solitary; hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce
self-interest
    Bertrand Russell
----
The most savage controversies are those about matters as to which there is no
good evidence either way. Persecution is used in theology, not in arithmetic.
    Bertrand Russell

Advocates of capitalism are very apt to appeal to the sacred principles of
liberty, which are embodied in one maxim: The fortunate must not be restrained
in the exercise of tyranny over the unfortunate

A life without adventure is likely to be unsatisfying, but a life in which
adventure is allowed to take whatever form it will is sure to be short.

let your reactions to the things and persons that interest you be as far as
possible friendly rather than hostile.

Ethics is in origin the art of recommending to others the sacrifices required
for cooperation with oneself.

Unless a man has been taught what to do with success after getting it, the
achievement of it must inevitably leave him a prey to boredom.

Mathematics is the only science where one never knows what one is talking about
nor whether what is said is true
    Bertrand Russell

By religion I mean a set of beliefs held as dogmas, dominating the conduct of
life, going beyond or contrary to evidence, and inculcated by methods which are
emotional or authoritarian, not intellectual
    Bertrand Russell
----
Mathematics, rightly viewed, posses not only truth, but supreme beauty; a
beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture

Few people can be happy unless they hate some other person, nation, or creed

I do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be
kept from increasing. There are others, which, one must suppose, opponents of

Law in origin was merely a codification of the power of dominant groups, and
did not aim at anything that to a modern man would appear to be justice

I like mathematics because it is not human and has nothing particular to do
with this planet or with the whole accidental universe - because, like

The qualities most needed are charity and tolerance, not some form of fanatical
faith such as is offered to us by the various rampant isms

    Bertrand Russell

We must care about the world of our children and grandchildren, a world we may

    Bertrand Russell

A sense of duty is useful in work but offensive in personal relations. People
wish to be liked, not to be endured with patient resignation.
    Bertrand Russell
----
A truer image of the world, I think, is obtained by picturing things as entering
into the stream of time from an eternal world outside, than from a view which
regards time as the devouring tyrant of all that is.

Both in thought and in feeling, even though time be real, to realize the

War is based on deception.
    Sun Tzu

The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not
coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not
attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.

There has never been a protracted war from which a country has benefited.
    Sun Tzu
----
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem
unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must
make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe
we are near.

----
All war is deception.

The one who figures on victory at headquarters before even doing battle is the
one who has the most strategic factors on his side.

If you know the enemy and know yourself, your victory will not stand in doubt;

The opportunity to secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but
the opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.

For them to perceive the advantage of defeating the enemy, they must also have

Confront them with annihilation, and they will then survive; plunge them into a

----
The skilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the
covetous man, and the stupid man.

In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy's
country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.
    Sun Tzu
----
There is no instance of a nation benefiting from prolonged warfare.

The enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full of caution.

    Sun Tzu

So there are five ways of knowing who will win. Those who know when to fight
and when not to fight are victorious. Those who discern when to use many or few
troops are victorious. Those whose upper and lower ranks have the same desire
are victorious.
    Sun Tzu

It is essential to seek out enemy agents who have come to conduct espionage

There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of these five

Now the reason the enlightened prince and the wise general conquer the enemy
whenever they move and their achievements surpass those of ordinary men is

    Sun Tzu

If our soldiers are not overburdened with money, it is not because they have a
distaste for riches; if their lives are not unduly long, it is not because they
are disinclined to longevity.
    Sun Tzu
----
The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without fearing
disgrace, whose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for
his sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.
    Sun Tzu
----
The ultimate in disposing one's troops is to be without ascertainable shape.
Then the most penetrating spies cannot pry in nor can the wise lay plans
against you.
    Sun Tzu
----
So the important thing in a military operation is victory, not persistence.
    Sun Tzu
----
To perceive victory when it is known to all is not really skilful. Everyone
calls victory in battle good, but it is not really good.
    Sun Tzu
----
In peace prepare for war, in war prepare for peace. The art of war is of vital
importance to the state. It is matter of life and death, a road either to
safety or to ruin. Hence under no circumstances can it be neglected.
    Sun Tzu
----
It is imperative to contest all factions for complete victory, so the army is
not garrisoned and the profit can be total. This is the law of strategic siege.
    Sun Tzu
----
The best victory is when the opponent surrenders of its own accord before there
are any actual hostilities...It is best to win without fighting.
    Sun Tzu
----
Therefore a victorious army first wins and then seeks battle; a defeated army
first battles and then seeks victory.
    Sun Tzu
----
According to my assessment, even if you have many more troops than others, how
can that help you to victory?
    Sun Tzu

Of all those in the army close to the commander none is more intimate than the
secret agent; of all rewards none more liberal than those given to secret
agents; of all matters none is more confidential than those relating to secret
operations.
    Sun Tzu
----
If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even though the
ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result is victory, then you must not
fight, even at the ruler's bidding.
    Sun Tzu
----
The proximity of an army causes prices to go up; and high prices cause people's
substance to be drained away. When their substance is drained away, they will
be afflicted by heavy exactions. With this loss of substance and exhaustion of
strength, the homes of the people will be stripped bare, and their incomes
dissipated.
    Sun Tzu
----
One who sets the entire army in motion to chase an advantage will not attain it.
    Sun Tzu
----
Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed in his
attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise, for the result is waste
of time and general stagnation.

The more sand that has escaped from the hourglass of our life, the clearer we

    Niccolo Machiavelli

There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself,
the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither
for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good,
and the third kind useless.

Whosoever desires constant success must change his conduct with the times.

Men shrink less from offending one who inspires love than one who inspires fear.

He who wishes to be obeyed must know how to command.

There is no surer sign of decay in a country than to see the rites of religion

    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
So long as the great majority of men are not deprived of either property or
honor, they are satisfied
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
And here comes in the question whether it is better to be loved rather than
feared, or feared rather than loved. It might perhaps be answered that we
should wish to be both; but since love and fear can hardly exist together, if
we must choose between them, it is far safer to be feared than loved....I sum
up by saying that since his being loved depends upon his subjects, while his
being feared depends upon himself, [one] should build on what is his own, and
not on what rests with others.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men in general judge more from appearances than from reality. All men have
eyes, but few have the gift of penetration
    Niccolo Machiavelli

For as laws are necessary that good manners be preserved, so there is need of
good manners that law may be maintained

War is just when it is necessary; arms are permissible when there is no hope
except in arms.

Entrepreneurs are simply those who understand that there is little difference
between obstacle and opportunity and are able to turn both to their advantage.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men in general judge more by the sense of sight than by the sense of touch,
because everyone can see, but only a few can test by feeling. Everyone sees
what you seem to be, few know what you really are, and those few do not dare
take a stand against the general opinion.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Of mankind we may say in general they are fickle, hypocritical, and greedy of
gain.

There is no avoiding war; it can only be postponed to the advantage of others.

One who deceives will always find those who allow themselves to be deceived.

There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor
more dangerous to handle, that to institute a new order of things
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men are so simple and so much inclined to obey immediate needs that a deceiver
will never lack victims for his deceptions
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
If an injury has to be done to a man it should be so severe that his vengeance
need not be feared
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
A prince must imitate the fox and the lion, for the lion cannot protect himself
from traps, and the fox cannot defend himself from wolves. One must therefore
be a fox to recognize traps, and a lion to frighten wolves. Those that wish to
be only lions do not understand this. Therefore, a prudent ruler ought not to
keep faith when by so doing it would be against his interest, and when the
reasons which made him bind himself no longer exist. If men were all good, this
precept would not be a good one; but as they are bad, and would not observe
their faith with you, so you are not bound to keep faith with them.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
It is not titles that honor men, but men that honor titles.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
The question is, then, do we try to make things easy on ourselves or do we try
to make things easy on our customers, whoever they may be?
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
And if, to be sure, sometimes you need to conceal a fact with words, do it in
such a way that it does not become known, or, if it does become known, that you
have a ready and quick defense
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Where the willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
The new ruler must determine all the injuries that he will need to inflict. He
must inflict them once and for all.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
A wise ruler ought never to keep faith when by doing so it would be against his
interests.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men should be either treated generously or destroyed, because they take revenge
for slight injuries - for heavy ones they cannot
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Princes and governments are far more dangerous than other elements within
society.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
No enterprise is more likely to succeed than one concealed from the enemy until
it is ripe for execution.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
It is necessary for him who lays out a state and arranges laws for it to
presuppose that all men are evil and that they are always going to act
according to the wickedness of their spirits whenever they have free scope
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Hence it comes about that all armed prophets have been victorious, and all
unarmed prophets have been destroyed.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
The wish to acquire more is admittedly a very natural and common thing; and
when men succeed in this they are always praised rather than condemned. But
when they lack the ability to do so and yet want to acquire more at all costs,
they deserve condemnation for their mistakes.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Benefits should be conferred gradually; and in that way they will taste better
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men are more apt to be mistaken in their generalizations than in their
particular observations.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men rise from one ambition to another: first, they seek to secure themselves
against attack, and then they attack others.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
The one who adapts his policy to the times prospers, and likewise that the one
whose policy clashes with the demands of the times does not.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Severities should be dealt out all at once, so that their suddenness may give
less offense; benefits ought to be handed ought drop by drop, so that they may
be relished the more.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
We cannot attribute to fortune or virtue that which is achieved without either.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
War should be the only study of a prince. He should consider peace only as a
breathing-time, which gives him leisure to contrive, and furnishes as ability
to execute, military plans.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
The fact is that a man who wants to act virtuously in every way necessarily
comes to grief among so many who are not virtuous.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
A return to first principles in a republic is sometimes caused by the simple
virtues of one man. His good example has such an influence that the good men
strive to imitate him, and the wicked are ashamed to lead a life so contrary to
his example.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
A prince never lacks legitimate reasons to break his promise
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
It is better to be bold than too circumspect, because fortune is of a sex which
likes not a tardy wooer and repulses all who are not ardent
    Niccolo Machiavelli

Men sooner forget the death of their father than the loss of their patrimony.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
A wise man will see to it that his acts always seem voluntary and not done by
compulsion, however much he may be compelled by necessity.
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
There is no other way for securing yourself against flatteries except that men
understand that they do not offend you by telling you the truth; but when
everybody can tell you the truth, you fail to get respect
    Niccolo Machiavelli
----
Men nearly always follow the tracks made by others and proceed in their affairs
by imitation, even though they cannot entirely keep to the tracks of others or
emulate the prowess of their models. So a prudent man should always follow in
the footsteps of great men and imitate those who have been outstanding. If his
own prowess fails to compare with theirs, at least it has an air of greatness
about it. He should behave like those archers who, if they are skilful, when
the target seems too distant, know the capabilities of their bow and aim a good
deal higher than their objective, not in order to shoot so high but so that by
aiming high they can reach the target.
    Niccolo Machiavelli

future time. The damage was done.

Living with integrity means: Not settling for less than what you know you

When we're incomplete, we're always searching for somebody to complete us.
When, after a few years or a few months of a relationship, we find that we're
still unfulfilled, we blame our partners and take up with somebody more
promising. This can go on and on--series polygamy--until we admit that while a
partner can add sweet dimensions to our lives, we, each of us, are responsible
for our own fulfillment. Nobody else can provide it for us, and to believe
otherwise is to delude ourselves dangerously and to program for eventual
failure every relationship we enter.

Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues

1. Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.
2. Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling
conversation.
3. Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business
have its time.
4. Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you
resolve.
5. Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste
nothing.
6. Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all
unnecessary actions.
7. Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you
speak, speak accordingly.
8. Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are
your duty.
9. Moderation. Avoid extreams; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think
they deserve.
10. Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.
11. Tranquility. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or
unavoidable.
12. Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dulness,
weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.
13. Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

If you want to understand your parents more, get them to talk about their own

All the events you have experienced in your lifetime up to this moment have been

I have never understood the importance of having children memorize battle dates.

important subjects such as How the Mind Works, How to Handle Finances, How to
Invest Money for Financial Security, How to be a Parent, How to Create Good
Relationships, and How to Create and Maintain Self-Esteem and Self-Worth. Can
you imagine what a whole generation of adults would be like if they had been
taught these subjects in school along with their regular curriculum?

The mental thought patterns that cause the most dis-ease in the body are
CRITICISM, ANGER, RESENTMENT and GUILT. For instance, criticism indulged in long
enought will often lead to dis-eases such as arthritis. Anger turns into things
that boil and burn and infect the body. Resentment long held festers and eats
away at the self and ultimately can lead to tumors and cancer. Guilt always
seeks punishment and leads to pain.

Youth is impulsive. When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary

The Doctor: You just want cruelty to beget cruelty. You're not superior to
people who were cruel to you. You're just a whole bunch of new cruel people.
A whole bunch of new cruel people, being cruel to some other people, who'll
end up being cruel to you. The only way anyone can live in peace is if they're
prepared to forgive. Why don't you break the cycle?

Bonnie: Why should we?

The Doctor: What is it that you actually want?

Bonnie: War.

The Doctor: Ah. And when this war is over, when -- when you have the homeland
free from humans, what do you think it's going to be like? Do you know?
Have you thought about it? Have you given it any consideration? Because you're
very close to getting what you want. What's it going to be like? Paint me a
picture. Are you going to live in houses? Do you want people to go to work?
What'll be holidays? Oh! Will there be music? Do you think people will be
allowed to play violins? Who will make the violins? Well?
Oh, You don't actually know, do you? Because, just like every other tantruming
child in history, Bonnie, you don't actually know what you want. So, let me
ask you a question about this brave new world of yours. When you've killed all
the bad guys, and it's all perfect and just and fair, when you have finally got
it exactly the way you want it, what are you going to do with the people like
you? The troublemakers.
How are you going to protect your glorious revolution from the next one?

Bonnie: We'll win.

Doctor: Oh, will you? Well maybe -- maybe you will win. But nobody wins for
long. The wheel just keeps turning. So, come on. Break the cycle.

Bonnie: Then why are you still talking?

The Doctor: Because I'm trying to get you to see. And I'm almost there.

Bonnie: Do you know what I see, Doctor? A box. A box with everything I need.
A 50% chance.

Kate: For us, too.

[The Doctor sighs.]

The Doctor: And we're off! Fingers on buzzers! Are you feeling lucky?
Are you ready to play the game? Who's going to be quickest? Who's going to be
the luckiest?

Kate: This is not a game!

The Doctor: No, it's not a game, sweetheart, and I mean that most sincerely.

Bonnie: Why are you doing this?

Kate: Yes, I'd like to know that too. You set this up -- why?

The Doctor: Because it's not a game, Kate. This is a scale model of war.
Every war ever fought right there in front of you. Because it's always the same.
When you fire that first shot, no matter how right you feel, you have no idea
who's going to die. You don't know who's children are going to scream and burn.
How many hearts will be broken! How many lives shattered!
How much blood will spill until everybody does what they're always going to
have to do from the very beginning -- sit down and talk! Listen to me, listen.
I just -- I just want you to think. Do you know what thinking is?
It's just a fancy word for changing your mind.

Bonnie: I will not change my mind.

The Doctor: Then you will die stupid. Alternatively, you could step away from
that box. You could walk right out of that door, and you could stand your
revolution down.

Bonnie: No, I'm not stopping this, Doctor. I started it. I will not stop it.
You think they'll let me go after what I've done?

The Doctor: You're all the same, you screaming kids, you know that?
"Look at me, I'm unforgivable." Well here's the unforeseeable, I forgive you.
After all you've done. I forgive you.

Bonnie: You don't understand. You will never understand.

The Doctor: I don't understand? Are you kidding? Me? Of course I understand.
I mean, do you call this a war, this funny little thing? This is not a war.
I fought in a bigger war than you will ever know. I did worse things than you
could ever imagine, and when I close my eyes... I hear more screams than anyone
could ever be able to count! And do you know what you do with all that pain?
Shall I tell you where you put it? You hold it tight... Til it burns your hand.
And you say this -- no one else will ever have to live like this.
No one else will ever have to feel this pain. Not on my watch.

[Kate closes her box.]

The Doctor: Thank you. Thank you.

Kate: I'm sorry.

The Doctor: I know. I know, thank you.

[The Doctor looks back to Bonnie.]

Well?

Bonnie: It's empty, isn't it? Both boxes -- there's nothing in them.
Just buttons.

The Doctor: Of course. But you know how you know that? Because you've started
to think like me. It's hell, isn't it? No one should have to think like that.
And no one will. Not on our watch.

[The Doctor and Bonnie stare at one another for a moment.]

The Doctor: Gotcha.

Bonnie: How can you be so sure?

The Doctor: Because you have a disadvantage, Zygella. I know that face.

Kate: Well, this is all very well, but as know the boxes are empty now.
We can't forget that.

The Doctor: No, well, uh... You've said that the last 15 times.

[The Doctor uses his sunglasses, which begin pulsing.]

Bonnie: You didn't wipe my memory.

The Doctor: No. Just Kate's. Oh, and your little friends here, of course.
When they wake up, they won't remember what you've done. It'll be our secret.

Bonnie: You're going to protect me?

Osgood: Well, you're one of us now, whether you like it or not.

Bonnie: I don't understand how You could just forgive me.

The Doctor: Because I've been where you have. There was another box.
I was gonna press another button. I was going to wipe out all of my own kind.
Man, woman, and child. I was so sure I was right.

Bonnie: What happened?

The Doctor: Same thing that happened to you. I let Clara Oswald get inside my
head.

[The Doctor looks at Clara.]

The Doctor: Trust me... She doesn't leave.

If I didn't take people where they hired me to take them, I wouldn't expect
them to get back on my bus. We expect leaders to take us where we want to go.

when leaders become something else. Politicians.

Professional Book Editor: Having your novel, short story or nonfiction
manuscript proofread or edited before submitting it can prove invaluable. In an

The Universe speaks in many languages but only one voice. A language which is
not Narn or Human or Centauri or Gaim or Minbari.
It speaks in the language of hope.

It speaks in the language of trust. It speaks in the language of strength and
the language of compassion. It is the language of the heart and of the language
of the soul; but always it is the same voice; it is the voice of our ancestors
speaking through us, and the voice of our inheritors waiting to be born; it is
the small still voice that says: "We are one." No matter the blood, no matter
the skin, no matter the world, no matter the star. We are one. No matter the
pain, no matter the darkness, no matter the loss, no matter the fear. We are
one. Here, gathered together in common cause we agree to recognize this singular
truth and this singular rule: that we must be kind to one another.

Because each voice enriches us and ennobles us, and each voice lost diminishes
us. We are the voice of the universe, the soul of creation, the fire that will
light the way to a better future.  We are one.

We are one.

The notion of the perfect whole, the ultimate solution in which all good things
coexist, seems to me not merely unobtainable--that is a truism--but conceptually

All central beliefs on human matters spring from a personal predicament.
    Isaiah Berlin
----
If you are truly convinced that there is some solution to all human problems,
that one can conceive an ideal society which men can reach if only they do what
is necessary to attain it, then you and your followers must believe that no
price can be too high to pay in order to open the gates of such a paradise.
Only the stupid and malevolent will resist once certain simple truths are put
to them. Those who resist must be persuaded; if they cannot be persuaded, laws
must be passed to restrain them; if that does not work, then coercion, if need
be violence, will inevitably have to be used—if necessary, terror, slaughter.
    Isaiah Berlin
----
Out of the crooked timber of humanity, nothing completely straight was ever made
    Isaiah Berlin
----
[People] cannot live without seeking to describe and explain the universe to
themselves. The models they use in doing this must deeply affect their lives,
not least when they are unconscious; much of [their] misery and frustration...
is due to the mechanical and unconscious, as well as deliberate, application of
models where they do not work…The goal of philosophy is always the same, to
assist [people] to understand themselves and thus operate in the open and not
wildly, in the dark.
    Isaiah Berlin
----
The underlying assumption that human nature is basically the same at all times,
everywhere, and obeys eternal laws beyond human control, is a conception that
only a handful of bold thinkers have dared to question.

avoid what others avoid?
How ridiculous!

Other people are excited,
as though they were at a parade.
I alone don't care,
I alone am expressionless,

Other people have what they need;
I alone possess nothing.
I alone drift about,
like someone without a home.
I am like an idiot, my mind is so empty.

Other people are bright;
I alone am dark.
Other people are sharp;
I alone am dull.

Controlling without authority,
This is love.
